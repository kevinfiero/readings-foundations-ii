**Read 04a: URL Search Params, URL Hash, & Hash Change Event**
* These first two articles are MDN references to using URLSearchParams. We used this in our Adventure Quest lab but was not familiar with all the functionality available.
* I am familiar with a few of the Location properties such as reload, replace, and href. I am interested to see how the others would be applied.
* I noticed a hashchange event today when I was in my GitHub account. For example, if you navigate to a file in GitHub and click on line 13 on the left side of a .js file the URL will append a #L13 to the URL. This allows users to navigate to the exact line when serving up the URL.

**Read 04b: Regular Expressions (Regex)**
* I am familiar with Regex but every time I see it I never know what it is trying to to accomplish!
* This can be useful for parsing or translating data with a fine tooth comb.
* I am definitely going to bookmark these resources to come back when needed.

**Read 04c: Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises, and fetch**
* This is a review of callbacks that we have been doing over the past few labs. There are downsides to callbacks, as stated in the article, such as too much nesting.
* The article on promises is making my head spin. I thought callbacks were complicated! I can understand that these are used for asynchronous processes and can be useful. However, I am not exactly following the implementation details.
* The PromiseAll seems useful if you need to wait for multiple processes to finish before proceeding.
* After watching the video I got lost after he started using <code>.then</code>. 
* Fetch seems a little more straight forward in the video example where you are pulling data via URL.
