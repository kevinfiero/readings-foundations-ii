**Read 09: SQL Relations and Joins**
* I completed the joins lessons in SQLBolt. This covered the basics but from experience I know joins can get really messy when the data structure gets complicated.
* Database normalization is really important so that there isn't database bloat, there is a standardization in input (error checking), and avoids duplicates.
* The visual represenation of SQL joins is always helpful to see. From my experience I tend to use left joins or inner joins most frequently because they are the easiest to understand.
