**Read 03: Responsive Web Design**

**Shay Howeâ€™s intro to RWD**
* Responsive Web Design is meant to work on any size screen.
* Viewport dimensions are growing in popularity to account for RWD. This includs vw, vmin, vmax, and vh.
* Similairly, em and % units are more commonly used in RWD. Use the formula <code>result = target / context</code>
* These rules can also be extended to media queries.
* The "mobile first" rule suggests developing for a smaller viewport first as it is harder to get it right.

* This article suggests floats have a lot of problems. I would agree that they are hard to predict!!
